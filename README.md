# TerribleAssembly
 
 
A terrible brute force implementation in assembly that takes in 5, 5 digits numbers
from the user and then sorts them in ascending order.

Be warned it is terrible. 

To run yourself use Mars Mips simulator. Load the file in and assemble the code.
Run or debug the program by clicking the "Execute" tab. 
In order to be able to execute your program, you must assemble the code first using Run->Assemble (F3).
